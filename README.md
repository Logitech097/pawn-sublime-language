# Pawn Language Definitions and Extra Bits for Sublime Text

This started out as a copy of C++ definitions (since the Pawn language is similar)

I've removed a few unnecessary C++ things and will continue to update it.

Edits/pulls welcome, please contribute!

# To do:

Add some snippets for special syntax from commonly used libraries (such as YSI).
