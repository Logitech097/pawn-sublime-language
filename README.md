# Pawn Language Definitions and Extra Bits for Sublime Text

This started out as a copy of C++ definitions (since the Pawn language is similar)

I've removed a few unnecessary C++ things and will continue to update it.

Edits/pulls welcome, please contribute!

# To do:

Find out where 'int' is defined and remove it.

Add some snippets for keywords from commonly used libraries (YSI, Streamer, etc)

Add an autocomplete for all default SA:MP functions/callbacks.

Highlight native SA:MP tags:
- Float
- File
- PlayerText3D
- Text
- PlayerText
- Text3D
- Menu
- DB
- DBResult
